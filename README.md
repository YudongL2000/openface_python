## Already implemented
- facial landmark generation in numpy

- pdm implementation in numpy

- PCA for pdm processing in numpy

- CCRF implementation in pytorch

- SVR based experiment code in numpy

- hog loaders and preprocessing functions for extracted video facial features: lib/preprocess.py

- gaze_tracking functions (mostly inhereted from OpenFace 2.2)

- mediapipe facial detection method lib/tools.py

## To be done

- Head pose experiment code

- testing and building scripts for software

- system level code

- code for performing downstream tasks such as classification and facial recognition
